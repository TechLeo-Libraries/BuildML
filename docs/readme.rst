BuildML
=======

BuildML is a Python machine-learning library designed to simplify the
process of data preparation, feature engineering, model building, and
evaluation. It provides a collection of tools for both classification
and regression tasks, as well as functionalities for data exploration
and manipulation. BuildML is a distribution of the
